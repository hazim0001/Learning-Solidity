Bytes
We can create two types of byte arrays in Solidity: fixed-size and dynamically-sized. For now we're going to focus on the fixed-size array.

We can create byte sized arrays reserving anywhere from 1 to 32 bytes by adding the number as a suffix to bytes.

For instance:

bytes1 a = 0x1f; // 0001 1111
bytes2 b = 0xbeef; // 1011 1110 1110 1111
bytes3 c = 0xabcdef; // 1010 1011 1100 1101 1110 1111

byte b = 0xa3; // <-- byte is an alias for bytes1
☝️ You can see that each time we go up 1 byte we can store two new hexadecimal characters. Each hexadecimal character can be represented in 4 bits.

💡 Fun fact, 4 bits together are called a nibble! That means each hexadecimal character can be represented by 1 nibble. It also means two nibbles makes a byte!

We can make comparisons of bytes with <=, <, ==, !=, >=, and >. We can also access a byte using [ ] to access a specific byte.

For instance:

bytes2 a = 0x1337;

console.log( a[1] ); // 37
☝️ Here we grab the second byte inside of our two-byte array a.

🔍 There's also plenty of operators we can use to modify bytes. Let's take a look at them in details.

🏁 Your Goal: Make Cafe ☕
Create three public two-byte arrays a, b, and cafe state variables.

The variables a and b can store any two bytes, while cafe should store 0xcafe.

To challenge your binary skills, try to use the values in a and b to create 0xcafe. 🏆

If we were trying to get 1337 for instance:

bytes2 public a = 0x1023; // 0001 0000 0010 0011
bytes2 public b = 0x0314; // 0000 0011 0001 0100
bytes2 public leet = a | b;  // 0001 0011 0011 0111
