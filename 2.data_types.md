Basic Solidity Data Types
In this tutorial we'll learn basic Solidity data types!

We'll use state variables to store them in the contract's persistent data storage:

contract Contract {
    bool public value = true;
    int public a = 10;
    string public msg = "Hello World";
}
☝️ Some of these variables should look familiar to you from JavaScript! There appears to be a boolean, a number and a string. 🧐

In Solidity we're going to have to look at each of these data types in closer detail. 🔬

Since Smart Contracts deal primarily with digital value, it's important to understand everything that is happening on a granular level. Any mistake could have dire consequences! It's also important to do things efficiently since all storage and computation on the blockchain will cost money.

With this in mind, let's dive into Basic Solidity Data Types!
