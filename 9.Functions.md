Solidity Functions
We've learned about how to store values inside of our smart contracts. Now it's time to learn how to read and modify those values! We accomplish this by adding functions to our contract code.

Technically we already created functions in the previous lesson on data types! By setting our state variables to public, the compiler was creating a getter function under the hood:

contract Contract {
    uint public x = 3;
}
‚òùÔ∏è We can query the value in x externally using a generated function called x().

What if we wanted to modify x? ü§î

contract Contract {
    uint public x = 3;

    function changeX() external {
        x = 5;
    }
}
